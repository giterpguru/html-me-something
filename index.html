        <h1>Arumugam Vairavan's Personal and Professional Journey</h1> 
    </p>
  
    <article>
 
    <h2>Period (1997 - 2000)</h2>  <P> I completed my Masters in Computer Science degree from Bishop Heber College in Trichy,Tamilnadu,India in 1997. Trichy is a small town
    in Tamilnadu,India. I shifted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai" target="_blank">Chennai</a> metro for finding jobs. During my initial 3 years of my career I had to struggle taking up small teaching jobs,
    few contracting IT jobs. I did self trained myself in Oracle,Oracle Forms and Visual Basic. Between 1997 to 2000, Mainframe, AS400 and Client 
    Server technology jobs are in demand. </P>    
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>According to me, teaching software is not that easy because as a trainer you cannot be familiar with all the features. Students who
    take up the courses are not always novice, they come with the industry experience and knowledge, answering to their questions
    is not an easy job.This period was a tough period in my life</p>
    <h3>Turning Points</h3>
    <P>During my last job in 2000 at STG, I had to train for a few associates of Corporate Companies. By looking at my problem solving skills,
    a few companies interviewed me and I was able to crack 2 of their interviews, one of them was a IT Programmer in Malaysia and the second one was
    a Software Engineer position in an MNC. I decided to join the MNC in chennai </P>
